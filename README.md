# README

This project is a mini-facebook-clone, inspired by The Odin Project, https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-rails-final-project

Still to do:

* Page layout

* Navigation bar

* Edit comments in-place

* Buttons (friendship / likes) should work without re-displaying the whole page
